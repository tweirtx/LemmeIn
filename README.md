# LemmeIn

Slack bot and web UI that people can request entry with.

Use case designed for: a robotics team's robotics lab is in an inner sector of a building, and the door to get in to the building is far away from the lab. Instead of designating a person to miss the first 15 minutes of the meeting to sit by the door and let people in, they can go to a website, enter their name, and their name and which door they are at will be sent to a Slack channel.
